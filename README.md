# Data-Stractures - Cancel-Recursion

This project shows an algorithem and the use of it by 2 functions, 1 with recursion and 1 without recursion.
Basically, we need to deliver the connections between computers.
Each computer connectes to other computers and the algoritehm "Find accessible" suppose to give us the result of the current computer
and his connections, but, the implementaion is from 2 functions as shown above.

# How it works?
1. input for example:
2. 5 5 1 4 3 2 3 5 2 4 4 5
3. Choose a computer number
4. The output is: the accsible computers from the computer the user picked.
5. There are 2 outputs, 1 from the function with recursion and 1 from the function without recursion.
